Hypothesis Testing - Core
# Overview 
We have been tasked to understand electric car usage. I will work as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.

# Define The Question
If The Number of Cars Taken in Postal Code 75015 is Different From That in 75017. 

# Metric for Success
Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
Plot appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries recording our observations.
Implement the solution by performing hypothesis testing.
This will need to be documented when writing the report. 

# Context 
We have been tasked to understand electric car usag. We will work as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.

In an effort to do this, we need to identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made.
